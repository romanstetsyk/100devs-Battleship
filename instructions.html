      You will play against a computer player by using a 10×10 grid in virtual Battleship. The player/computer who destroys the totality of their opponent’s fleet wins the game. 
      After the ships are randomly positioned, each opponent will fire upon squares in the adverse grid and try to sink their enemies fleet in turns. If the player/computer hits a ship,
      they will get another turn until they miss. The program indicates automatically whether there has been a hit or a miss; a white square indicates a miss, a yellow square indicates a hit,
      and when all connecting squares turn red, the ship has been sunk.

    <p>
      Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them. 
      A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. 
      Since then, the game has spawned various video games and smartphone app variations. Today, the board game version is produced by Hasbro, the company that acquired Milton Bradley in 1984.
